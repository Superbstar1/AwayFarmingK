# AwayFarmingK
A simple stand-alone WPF project that allows afk "Use Item" action in Minecraft 1.13

This project was the result of a channel discussion on LogicalGeekBoy's discord server, regarding the breakage of most AFK farms that utilize "tricking" the Minecraft Client into thinking the "Use Item" button is being held, in 1.13. The core bits of it were ripped from a testing project I wrote and have been provided as a simple interface. A cross-platform version of this may be in development, as time allows.

Written fast and ugly, but functional.
